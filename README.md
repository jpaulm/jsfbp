jsfbp
=====

Basic FBP implementation written in JavaScript, using Node-Fibers - https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers .

General
---

Test cases so far:

- `fbptest1` - 3 processes:
    - `Sender`
    - `Copier`
    - `Recvr`

![JSFBP](https://github.com/jpaulm/jsfbp/blob/master/docs/JSFBP.png "Simple Test Network")

- `fbptest2` - `Sender` replaced with `Reader`
- `fbptest3` - `Sender` and `Reader` both feeding into `Copier.IN`
- `fbptest4` - `Sender` feeding `Repl` which sends 3 copies of input IP (as specified in network), each copy going to a separate element of array port `OUT`; all 3 copies then feeding into `Recvr.IN`
- `fbptest5` - Two copies of `Reader` running concurrently
- `fbptest6` - The output streams of the `Repl` (in `fbptest4`) are fed to an input array port
- `fbptest7` - Creates a deadlock condition - the status of each process is displayed
- `fbptest8` - reads text, reverses it twice and outputs it
- `fbptest9` - `Copier` in `fbptest1` is replaced with a Copier which terminates prematurely and closes its input port, bringing the network down (ungracefully!)
- `fbptest10` -  `Copier` in `fbptest1` is replaced with a non-looping Copier
- `fbptest11` -  Load balancer (`lbal`) feeding 3 instances of a random delay component (`randdelay`)
  
![Fbptest11](https://github.com/jpaulm/jsfbp/blob/master/docs/Fbptest11.png "Diagram of fbptest11 above")

- `fbptest12` -  `Reader -> Copier -> Writer`
 
Some of these have tracing set on, depending on what testing was being done when they were promoted!

These tests can be run sequentially by running `fbptests.bat`.
 
Components
---

- `concat`  - concatenates all the streams that are sent to its array input port (size determined in network definition) 
- `copier`  - copies its input stream to its output stream
- `copier_closing` - forces close of input port after 20 IPs
- `copier_nonlooper` - same as `copier`, except that it is written as a non-looper
- `lbal`    - load balancer - sends output to output port array element with smallest number of IPs in transit
- `randdelay` - sends incoming IPs to output port after random number of millisecs (between 0 and 400)
- `reader`  - does an asynchronous read on the file specified by its FILE IIP 
- `recvr`   - receives its incoming stream and displays the contents on the console 
- `repl`    - replicates the incoming IPs to the streams specified by an array output port (it does not handle tree structures)
- `reverse` - reverses the string contained in each incoming IP
- `rrmerge` - "round robin" merge 
- `sender`  - sends as many IPs to its output port as are specified by its COUNT IIP (each just contains the current count)
- `writer`  - does an asynchronous write to the file specified by its FILE IIP 

 
API
---
Defining network:
- start with `var fbp = require('./fbp.js');`
- `fbp.defProc` - define Process
- `fbp.connect` - connect output port to input port
- `fbp.initialize` - specify IIP and the port it is connected to
 
- finish with
- `var trace = true;`  or `... false` - specify whether tracing desired
- `fbp.run(trace);`
  
Component services:
- `var ip = IP.create(contents);` - create an IP containing `contents`
- `IP.drop(ip);` - drop IP
  
- `var inport = InputPort.openInputPort('IN');` - create InputPort variable  
- `var array = InputPortArray.openInputPortArray('IN');` - create input array port array
- `var outport = OutputPort.openOutputPort('OUT');` - create OutputPort variable 
- `var array = OutputPortArray.openOutputPortArray('OUT');` - create output array port array   
  
- `var ip = inport.receive();` - returns null if end of stream 
- `var ip = array[i].receive();` - receive to element of port array
- `outport.send(ip);` - returns -1 if send unable to deliver
- `array[i].send(ip);` - send from element of port array
- `inport.close();` - close input port (or array port element)
  
-  `fbp.setCallbackPending(true);` - used when doing asynchronous I/O in component
-  `queueCallback(proc[,data]);` - queue the callback to the JSFBP future events queue
-  `fbp.getElementWithSmallestBacklog(array);` - used by `lbal` - not for general use

Install & Run
---

1. Install node.js - see http://nodejs.org/download/

2. Clone or download this project

3. Run `npm install` in the project directory

4. Run `node script/fbptestx.js`, where `fbptestx` is any of the tests listed above. If tracing is desired, change the value of the `trace` variable at the bottom of fbptest.js to `true`.

Tracing
---

Here is a sample section of the trace output for `fbptest8.js`:
```
Reverse2 recv from Reverse2.IN
Reverse2 recv OK:
 deificeps era snoitcennoc eht erehw ,gnissap egassem yb snoitcennoc denifederp
Reverse2 send to Reverse2.OUT: predefined connections by message passing, where
the connections are specified
Recvr recv OK: applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange
 data across

esses can be reconnected endlessly

```

Performance
---

This first test case (Jan. 16, 2015) with 2000 IPs running through three processes takes 200 ms, giving approx. 50 microsecs per send/receive pair.
