In computer programming, Flow-Based Programming (FBP) is a programming paradigm that 
uses a "data factory" metaphor for designing and building applications. FBP defines 
applications as networks of "black box" processes, which exchange data across 
predefined connections by message passing, where the connections are specified 
externally to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly 
to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is 
thus naturally component-oriented.
